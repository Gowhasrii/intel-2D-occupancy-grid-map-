PROBLEM STATEMENT DEFINES:

This project aims to enhance the navigation capabilities of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in indoor environments by creating a detailed 2D occupancy grid map using overhead cameras. Similar to the maps generated by AMRs using ROS2-based SLAM algorithms, this map will provide a clear representation of the surroundings, identifying static obstacles such as chairs, tables, and boxes, while dynamically updating to reflect changes like the movement of furniture.

The primary challenge is to maintain the accuracy of the map despite variations in lighting, perspective distortions, and the dynamic nature of indoor spaces. Addressing this challenge will improve AMRs' ability to autonomously plan paths, avoid collisions, and navigate efficiently in environments with unpredictable conditions. This capability is essential for applications such as warehouse logistics, automated cleaning, and healthcare assistance, where AMRs must operate safely and effectively alongside humans.
