PROBLEM STATEMENT DEFINES:
This project addresses the need for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to navigate indoor environments
with precision and adaptability. By developing a detailed 2D occupancy grid map using overhead cameras,
similar to those employed by AMRs with ROS2-based SLAM algorithms, the aim is to provide these robots
with a clear understanding of their surroundings. This map not only identifies static obstacles like chairs,
tables, and boxes but also dynamically updates to accommodate changes in the environment, such as the
movement of furniture items.
The key challenge lies in ensuring the accuracy of this map despite variations in lighting, perspective
distortions, and the dynamic nature of indoor spaces. By solving this problem, the project enhances AMRs'
ability to autonomously plan paths, avoid collisions, and navigate efficiently in environments where
conditions can change unpredictably. This capability is crucial for applications ranging from warehouse
logistics and automated cleaning to healthcare assistance, where AMRs must operate safely and effectively
alongside humans.
